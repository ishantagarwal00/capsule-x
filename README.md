## Description

This project is a landing page built using React to display information about Capsules. It consists of three main sections: a modern banner, a search form with three filters, and a data grid to display capsule details. The search form allows users to filter capsules by status, original launch date, and type. The data grid is paginated and displays ten items per page. Clicking on an item in the grid opens a popup with more details. The design is responsive and optimized for various screen sizes and browsers.
